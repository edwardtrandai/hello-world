# hello-world
my first repository

Hello to anybody that is reading this, my name is Edward and I am currently learning how to code and am pursuing to have a career in the data science field. What I am currently tackling is mastering Python. I'm interested learning hacking and security practices of all kinds but I am not only an aspiring coder, I like to spend my free time watching interesting documentaries and engage in tactical video games as well.
